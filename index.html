            Technoblade makes the majority of his videos on the Minecraft server Hypixel. The time range between his video uploads is usually a week to a month, though he has tried (and failed) to do daily episodes. He also streams Minecraft content live on YouTube, playing on the popular Minecraft server Hypixel, Minecraft Mondays, MC Championship, SMP Earth, Minecraft Story Mode, Party Games and the Dream SMP. He is part of Sleepyboisinc along with Wilbur Soot, Ph1LzA and TommyInnit. He has been nicknamed "The Blade" by Tommy.

            In the past, Technoblade mostly uploaded Blitz Survival Games. His 500th episode special, titled "Ultimate Hunger Games," was his most-viewed video before he gained more popularity. He has also made older videos of him doing things like cooking and green screen content showing his YouTube awards. Hypixel continues to be his main means of obtaining views.
            
            Technoblade is well-known throughout the Minecraft community for his skill in PVP (player-versus-player) combat. He has earned the [PIG+++] rank on Hypixel for winning the Minecraft Monday tournament four times, more than any other YouTuber. He has collaborated many times with other famous YouTubers, many of which have been through Minecraft Monday, some of whom were teammates during said event.
            
            In late November 2019, he joined a Minecraft server named SMP Earth, a Factions server where an assortment of YouTubers plays survival on a 3000:1 recreation of the Earth. Technoblade has also begun streaming different games aside from Minecraft, such as the popular Minecraft spin-off "Minecraft Story Mode", and "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord", which consists of 5 streams as of June 15. During the Potato War, Technoblade made multiple alternative Minecraft accounts such as Asiyn, Whitelisted, Whitelisted 2, PommesDeTerre, NoHaxCanJustFly, Ender_Gamer09 and BizarreZzz.
            
            Technoblade also plays Hypixel's version of Skyblock, often featuring his friends and co-op members, such as Jiyn, TimeDeo and xHascox. Technoblade has made an entire series of Hypixel Skyblock and is well-known for being "the fastest man in skyblock," as well as for his three-part Potato War saga in which he fought user Im_a_squid_kid for the #1 potato rank.
